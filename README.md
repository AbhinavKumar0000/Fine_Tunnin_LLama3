# Fine-Tuning Llama3 for Medical Q&A

This repository contains code for fine-tuning Meta's Llama3 model to function as a medical question-answering assistant.

## 📌 Overview

The project demonstrates how to:
- Fine-tune Llama3 using QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)
- Create a medical question-answering chatbot
- Deploy the model for inference with a streaming interface

## 🚀 Features

- Efficient fine-tuning with 4-bit quantization
- Alpaca prompt template for medical Q&A
- Interactive chat interface
- Text streaming for real-time responses

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbhinavKumar0000/Fine_Tunnin_LLama3.git
cd Fine_Tunnin_LLama3
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
🧠 Fine-Tuning Process
The fine-tuning notebook (Fine_tunning_.ipynb) covers:

Setting up the environment

Loading Llama3-8B with 4-bit quantization

Preparing the medical Q&A dataset

Configuring QLoRA parameters:

LoRA rank (r) = 64

Alpha = 16

Dropout = 0.1

Training the model

💬 Running the Chatbot
After fine-tuning, you can run the interactive chatbot:

python
python chat.py
Example usage:

text
Welcome to AI Health Chatbot! Type 'exit' to quit
You: What are the symptoms of diabetes?
Bot: The common symptoms of diabetes include...

Key notes about this README:
1. I've structured it to clearly explain what the project does
2. Included installation and usage instructions
3. Added a file structure section for clarity
4. Mentioned hardware requirements (important for LLM work)
5. Kept it professional but approachable

You may want to:
- Add a "Dataset" section if you're using a specific medical dataset
- Include performance metrics if you have them
- Add screenshots of the chatbot in action
- Include contribution guidelines if you want others to contribute
